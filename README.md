# Software-Development-Journey
This repository details my journey in web design, utilizing 100Dev's curriculum and the Odin Project Curriculum.

## Jan 2026
### Jan 30
* Progress: Currently on the Basic HTML (#62) step of the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp.
* What have I learned: Have learned how to create a standard HTML boilerplate for standardization across browsers and to ensure seamless collaboration with other SWDs. HTML contains information of website. CSS will contain the design styles. JavaScript will imbue the site with interactivity.
### Jan 31
* Progress: Currently on the Basics HTML (#84) step of the Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp.
* What have I learned: I have learned about named references, nesting, and sibling elements. I have learned how to add interactive elements to my templates using HTML. I have begun learning how CSS files and HTML files connect beyond the <link> element and how to optimize styling pages.

## Feb 2026
### Feb 13
* Review: Reviewed Jan 31 material (designing a bookstore page).
* Progress: Learning how to draft complete pages in HTML using the basics and including descriptions in metadata to increase potential traffic to created websites. 
* What have I learned: I learned about curating metadata to enhance SEO and the theory of Open Graph tags. I am on step 87 of the course: Responsive Web Design Certification on freecodecamp.
### Feb 15
* Progress: Built on previous knowledge to begin adding media items to the basic boilerplate template.
* What have I learned: I learned about adding audio and video to a webpage, how to outfit the code to error handle based on browser compatibility and legacy media, and how to find public domain images and respect licenses. I also learned about the different file formats and how to render them correctly to save data and ensure a quality media display.
* Current Learning Step: 111 in Responsive Web Design Certification on freeCodeCamp.org.
### Feb 16
* Progress: Currently working on embedding external content into an HTML website and adding links, plus the best way to structure things to ensure maximum efficiency when using links.
* What have I learned: I learned about using external content in a website using an iframe and the limitations that it includes. I learned about how the structure of links reflects directory structures and learned how important directory and folder structures are in creating an efficient website. These types of things need to be mapped out before creating a website that references other things. EDIT: Learned about Links states and how they can be used to signal to the reader about their interactions with the page so far. Completed and passed the basic HTML exam.
* Current Learning: Begin again on https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design-v9/lecture-working-with-links/what-are-the-different-link-states. EDIT: Start on Semantic HTML next time.
### Feb 17
* Progress: Semantic HTML theory
* What have I learned: I learned the importance of using semantic HTML to ensure proper content structure to improve the rankings of my website in search engines and to ensure ADA-friendly websites. Also, it just good to utilize this html to ensure universal understanding of a html document for collaboration.
* Currently Learning: Doing Nuanced Semantic HTML.
### Feb 18 (Healing Day)
### Feb 19
* Progress: working on inputting more detailed items on a webpage beyond the traditional boilerplate template.
* What have I learned: I learned about organizing items using description lists, which organize labels and key related information into a list. I also learned about outdated, nuance,d idiomatic HTML, which have more appropriate semantic equivalents to convey meaning and abide by ADA. If we need to emphasize something visually that doesn't have meaning, it's best to style items using CSS.
* Next Time: Will learn about inline quotations.
### Feb 20
* Progress: working on inputting more context and details into the content of the HTML page for all accessibility level crowds. I am also working towards citing and referencing material beyond the standard links and differentiating that text from other text based on semantic HTML. I am also working on adding more details to the HTML page to help with SEO.
* What have I learned: I am learning how browsers process pages based on HTML content and how to enhance a webpage by including that information as tooltips, quotations, and date/time elements to create a good UX for all levels. Also had a little visit from a new HTML entity in the form of & mdash; (of course, there is no space between the ampersand and the following text to actually make the em dash :)
* Next Time: Working with specialized semantic elements.
### Feb 21
* Progress: making websites accessible and interactive using HTML.
* What have I learned: I learned about in-page links and how to correctly reference them. I learned about the importance of using the correct HTML tag so we can create an organized page that is sensible and user-friendly to all types of audiences.
* Next time: Forms and Tables
### Feb 22
* Progress: collecting data using websites
* What I learned: I learned how to make forms, with different input options like radio buttons, multi-choice selection using checkboxes, dropdowns, and text input controls. I learned how to use buttons to send data out to a server. I learned how to set behavior for elements that need user input. I learned about HTTPS requests, but not detailed information. More will be detailed in later chapters.
* Next Time: creating tables!
### Feb 23
* Progress: creating tables for tabular data (outdated method); CSS is used mostly now, but one should still know how to do it.
* What I learned: I learned how to create HTML tables from scratch. The syntax is pretty easy, but it's easy to get lost when you have more than a few rows to type out!
* Next Time: Working with HTML tools for validation and more!
